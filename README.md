torch-NetworkInNetwork
======================

a replication of Network in network in torch. 
original code : https://github.com/mavenlin/cuda-convnet

Learning rate 0.1 used as the original code, doesn't make the learning happen. 
Learning rate is set to 1e-3, and the accuracy gets to %86 not %89.6 :(
